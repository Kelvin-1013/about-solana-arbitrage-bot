These diagrams provide a comprehensive view of your Solana arbitrage bot's architecture, including:

1. The off-chain program that finds opportunities and builds transactions.
2. The on-chain program that executes the arbitrage.
3. The pool graph showing how different tokens are connected.
4. The DEX integration layer showing how different DEXes are integrated.
5. The key data structures used in the program.


The architecture allows for efficient arbitrage execution across multiple DEXes on Solana, with proper state management and security checks. The modular design of the DEX integration layer allows for easy addition of new DEXes in the future.
